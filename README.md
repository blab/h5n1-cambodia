## Abstract 
H5N1 viruses periodically cross species barriers and cause disease in humans. The likelihood that an avian influenza virus will acquire mammalian-adapting mutations and evolve enhanced mammalian transmissibility depends on its ability to acquire and select mutations within hosts during spillover. We use deep sequence data from infected humans and poultry in Cambodia to examine how H5N1 viruses evolve during natural spillover infection. We find that viral populations in both species are characterized by predominantly low-frequency (<10%) variation shaped by a combination of purifying selection and genetic drift. Human samples had a greater number of within-host polymorphisms on average, although the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies and overall mean SNP frequency was similar in both host species. We detect a handful of mutations in humans at sites explicitly linked to H5N1 mammalian adaptation (PB2 627 Lys, HA 150 Val, and HA 238 Leu), although these mutations were present at low frequencies, despite â‰¥8 days of infection. Finally, we show that mutations detected within-host are not enriched among viruses that have caused spillover infections in the past. By comparing signatures of diversity among humans and poultry, we show that H5N1 viruses are capable of generating known markers of human adaptation during natural spillover infection. However, a short duration of infection, randomness and purifying selection together severely limit the evolutionary capacity of H5N1 viruses to evolve extensively within human hosts.
